      <h1>My Vision For the World</h1>
      <br />
      <p>“Don't tell me the sky's the limit when there are footprints on the moon” is a quote that has always inspired me. It alludes to the fact that our reality — and the future — is what we make it. If we have an optimistic image in mind and choose to work towards it, we will get where we want to be in due time. My optimistic image (read: vision as an engineer) of the future is one of sustainability, co-habitation and balance.</p>
      <br />
      <p>I strongly believe that out current way of life is unsustainable and actively harmful to the environment. We need to stop global warming, deforestation and drought in their tracks and engineer tools that offset our carbon footprint. Additionally, I envision a future where we switch entirely to renewable sources of energy.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>It is obvious that parts of the world are in complete shambles right now. Just this year, we have had civil uprisings, riots, mini wars and assassinations and rampant looting. The world, right now, is full of prejudice and hate. Meaningful progress cannot happen in such times. To make significant positive progress of any kind (in any field), we need to work together. I envision a future where we stop all ego measuring contests and work towards world peace and true unity. After all, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together”.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Lastly, we need to strike a balance with our ecosystem. We need to understand that we are alive because our planet wills it so. We need to acknowledge that our planet’s delicate ecosystem can only bend so far before it inevitably breaks. If we don’t learn to respect nature and work with it (rather than against it), we will surely cease to exist. I envision a future where the environment is a top priority.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Any vision is simply a self fulfilling prophecy. The more you work towards it — and the more you convince others to work on it with you —, the more innovation happens and the closer we get to the fruition of our vision. It is up to us to choose our own future. I have chosen mine and cannot wait to help others envision it too.</p>
