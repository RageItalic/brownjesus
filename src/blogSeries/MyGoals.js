      <p>I plan to keep updating this post on a (semi) regular basis... So check back if you're interested!</p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Goal 1</h2>
      <p>By the end of August, I will finish a small personal personal project that I have been stalling for the past month. I will also build a small todo app with a financial incentive using the same tech stack that will help me retain my learnings.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>Goal 2</h2>
      <p>Before the end of the year, I will join a hackathon to work on a blockchain project potentially based around Defi (decentralised finance). I will aim to work with a team of people who have more experience that I do in the field.</p>
